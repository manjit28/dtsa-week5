## Week 5: GANs

This project is based on Kaggle competition "Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself". It is about a comprehensive setup for training a CycleGAN for translating between photographic images and paintings (specifically in the style of Monet), demonstrating advanced techniques in unsupervised machine learning for image style transfer.
